Changelog
=========

v1.3 (2012-05-07)
-----------------

* Dropped support for Django < 1.3 **backwards incompatible**

* Dropped using versiontools in favor of home made solution.

* Added optional support for TinyMCE editor instead of the CodeMirror
  editor (just enable ``DBTEMPLATES_USE_TINYMCE``).

* Fixed compatibility to Django 1.4's handling of the ``DATABASES``
  setting. Should also respect database routers now.

* Fixed an issue of the cache key generation in combination with
  memcache's inability to stomach spaces.

* Moved test runner to use nose_ and a hosted CI project at Travis_:
  http://travis-ci.org/jezdez/django-dbtemplates

v1.2.1 (2011-09-07)
-------------------

* Fixed a wrong use of the non-lazy localization tools.

* Fixed bugs in the documentation.

* Make use of django-appconf and versiontools.

v1.2 (2011-08-15)
-----------------

* Refactored the template loader to be even more cache effective.

* Added ``check_template_syntax`` management command and admin action
  to make sure the saved templates are valid Django templates.

v1.1.1 (2011-07-08)
-------------------

* Fixed bug in cache loading (again).

* Fixed bugs in the documentation.

.. note::

    Since ``dbtemplates`` removed support for Django lower than 1.2 you
    have to use the template loader class in the ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS``
    (``'dbtemplates.loader.Loader'``) and **not** the previosly included
    function that ended with ``load_template_source``.

v1.1 (2011-07-06)
-----------------

* **BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE** Requires Django 1.2 or higher.
  For previous Django versions use an older versions of ``dbtemplates``,
  e.g.::

        $ pip install "django-dbtemplates<1.1"

* Added South migrations.

.. note::

    If you are using South in your Django project, you can easily enable
    dbtemplates' migrations, *faking* the first migration by using the
    ``--fake`` option of South's ``migrate`` management command::

        $ manage.py migrate --fake 0001 dbtemplates

    Then run the rest of the migrations::

        $ manage.py migrate dbtemplates

* Removed uniqueness on the ``name`` field of the ``Template`` model. This is
  needed because there isn't a ``unique_together`` for M2M fields in Django
  such as the ``sites`` field in the ``Template`` model.

* Made the ``sites`` field optional to support a way to apply a template to
  all sites.

* Added ``--delete`` option to ``sync_templates`` managment command to delete
  the file or database entry after syncing (depending on used ``--overwrite``
  mode).

* Updated translations.

* Fixed issue with incorrectly splitting paths in ``sync_templates``.

* Extended tests.

* Fixed issue with cache settings handling.

v1.0.1 (2011-04-14)
-------------------

* Minor bugfixes with regard to the new cache handling.

v1.0 (2011-04-11)
-----------------

.. warning::
    This is the first stable release of django-dbtemplates which comes with a
    series of backwards incompatible changes.

* Removed own caching mechanism in favor of Django based caching mechanism.
  The ``DBTEMPLATES_CACHE_BACKEND`` is expected to be a valid cache backend
  URI, just like Django's own ``CACHE_BACKEND`` setting. In Django >= 1.3
  an ``'dbtemplates'`` entry in the ``CACHES`` setting is also considered
  valid.

* Added tox configuration to test ``dbtemplates`` on Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7
  with Django 1.1.X, 1.2.X and 1.3.X.

* Added Transifex configuration.

* Use ``STATIC_URL`` setting instead of ``MEDIA_URL`` for the media prefix.
  Also moved files from media/* to static/* to follow convention introduced
  in Django 1.3.

* Use ReadTheDocs for documentation hosting.

v0.8.0 (2010-11-07)
-------------------

* Added Finnish translation (by jholster)

* Added --overwrite and --app-first options to sync_templates command (by Alex Kamedov).

v0.7.4 (2010-09-23)
-------------------

* Fixed tests.

v0.7.3 (2010-09-21)
-------------------

* Added ``DBTEMPLATES_AUTO_POPULATE_CONTENT`` setting to be able to disable
  to auto-populating of template content.

* Fixed cosmetic issue in admin with collapsable fields.

v0.7.2 (2010-09-04)
-------------------

* Moved to Github again. Sigh.

v0.7.1 (2010-07-07)
-------------------

* Fixed problem with the CodeMirror textarea, which wasn't completely
  disabled before.

* Fixed problem with the ``DBTEMPLATES_MEDIA_PREFIX`` setting, which defaults
  now to ``os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'dbtemplates')`` now.
  
  In other words, if you don't specify a ``DBTEMPLATES_MEDIA_PREFIX`` setting
  and have the CodeMirror textarea enabled, dbtemplates will look in a
  subdirectory of your site's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` for the CodeMirror media files.

v0.7.0 (2010-06-24)
-------------------

* Added CodeMirror_-based syntax highlighting textarea, based on the amaxing
  work_ by `Nic Pottier`_. Set the ``DBTEMPLATES_USE_CODEMIRROR`` setting
  to ``True`` to enable it.

* Make use of the full width in plain textarea mode.

* Added Chinese translation

* Added support for Django 1.2

* Updated French translation

* Added ``DBTEMPLATES_USE_REVERSION`` setting to be able to explicitely enable
  reversion support. (Default: ``False``)
